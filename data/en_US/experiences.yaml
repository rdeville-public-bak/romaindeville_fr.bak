            ##### Description {.subtitle}

            Within the platform development team of the LIRIS, I contributed to
            the setup of the __[PAGoDA][pagoda]__ platform.


            This platform was designed to assist researchers in the
            specification, configuration and deployment stage of an environment
            to manage and analyze big data.

            ##### Activities {.subtitle}

            Regarding the __[PAGoDA][pagoda]__, my main activities were:


              - Hardware and software architecture design of the application,
              - Setup tools to automate the management of the platform, mainly
                via __Ansible__ to:
                  - Deploy the virtualize hardware architecture via
                    __OpenStack__,
                  - Deploy and configure containerization and orchestration
                    tools, such as __Docker__, __Rancher__, __Kubernetes__,
                    __Helm__,
              - Watch about monitoring systems and setup prototype, such as
                __Prometheus__, __Grafana__, __Elastic Stack__,
              - Write technical documentation, via __MkDocs__.


            In parallel with these activities, I contributed to the setup of
            automatic tools for __Continuous Integration__ (CI), such as:


              - Automatic deployment of hardware and software for __Gitlab
                Runners__,
              - Use of these runners to automatically deploy documentation, run
                linter and tests, etc.


            I also offered internal training in the laboratory about __Git__
            usage and about data security (__gpg__, __KeepassXC__, Hard Drive
            Encryption, …).

            ##### Description {.subtitle}

            Management of a __research project__ associated to the __ANR
            SoLSTiCE project__ which goal was to develop new models and tools to
            represent 2D (images) and 2D+t (videos, cellular automata) data.


            This project leads me to my PhD defense which title was
            __Spatio-temporal grid mining applied to image classification and
            cellular automata analysis__.

            ##### Activities {.subtitle}

            The main activities I had were:

              - __Development__ of tools and algorithm to mine grid,
              - __Plan__ and perform data experimentations,
              - __Autonomous work__.
