          The "**L**aboratoire d’**I**nfo**R**matique en **I**mage et
          **S**ystèmes d’information" (LIRIS) is a joined research unit (UMR
          5205) backed by the CNRS, INSA Lyon, University Claude Bernard Lyon,
          University Lumière and École Centrale de Lyon. It has 330 members.

          LIRIS research addresses a broad spectrum of computer science
          structured in 6 poles of expertise:

            ##### Description {.subtitle}

            Within the platform development team of the LIRIS, I designed and implement an experimentation plateform
            dedicated to research projects.

            This platform will allows researchers to easy deploy and run their experiments on large scale computer
            clusters and gather reproducible results.

            This project is called PAGoDA, which stand for TODO.

            ##### Responsabilites {.subtitle}

            Regarding the __[PAGoDA][pagoda]__, my main activities were:


              - Hardware and software architecture design of the application,
              - Setup tools to automate platform management, mainly
                via __Ansible__ to:
                  - Deploy the virtualized platform (OpenStack),
                  - Deploy and configure containerization and orchestration
                    tools, such as __Docker__, __Rancher__, __Kubernetes__,
              - Evaluation of different monitoring systems and setup prototype of the monitoring platform using
                __Prometheus__, __Grafana__ and the __Elastic Stack__,
              - Write technical documentation using __MkDocs__.


            In parallel with those activities, I contributed to the setup of
            tooling for __Continuous Integration__ (CI), such as:


              - Automatic provisionning and deployment of __Gitlab
                Runners__,
              - Setup of standard CI jobs around various CNRS projects for instance to deploy automaticaly documentation, run
                tests and linter and tests.


            I also offered internal training in the laboratory about __Git__
            and about data security (__gpg__, __KeepassXC__, Hard Drive
            Encryption).

            Main contributor to setup the deployment of the \textbf{PAGoDA}
            platform.

            TODO: Describe PAGoDA

            \begin{itemize}
              \item Setup tools to \textbf{automate the management} of hardware
                and software deployment,
              \item Watch about \textbf{monitoring} solutions and setup
                prototypes with such solutions.
              \item Write the technical documentation
            \end{itemize}

            In parallel with these activities, I contributed to the setup of
            automatic tools for \textbf{Continuous Integration} (CI).


            I also offered internal training in the laboratory about
            \textbf{Git} usage and about data security (\textbf{gpg},
            \textbf{KeepassXC}, Hard Drive Encryption, …).

            ##### Description {.subtitle}

            Realization of a __research project__ associated to the __ANR
            SoLSTiCE project__ aiming to develop new models and tools to
            represent 2D (images) and 2D+t (videos, cellular automata) data.

            During that time, I went from almost zero knowledsge on the subject
            of data mining to the implement of new algorithm which I compared
            to the current state-of-the-art.


            This project lead me to my thesis defense called
            __Spatio-temporal grid mining applied to image classification and
            cellular automata analysis__.

            ##### Responsabilities {.subtitle}

            The main activities I had were:

              - __Development__ of tools and algorithm to perform grid mining, which is a subset of graph mining,
              - __Plan__ and perform data experimentations,
              - Reading and understanding of many research papers on the subject,
              - __Autonomous work__.
